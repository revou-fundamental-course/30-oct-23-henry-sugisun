        <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
        <p> BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a numerical value of a person's weight in relation to their height. It's a simple and commonly used method to categorize individuals into different weight status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.</p>
        <p>Note: Keep in mind that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it doesn't directly measure body fat and may not be accurate for everyone, especially athletes with a high muscle mass. Always consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment of your health. If you want, I can calculate your BMI for you! Just give me your weight and height.</p>
